# phyphox_java_interface
A connection between the phyphox app and java to analyse the data using java

This interface can be used to connect a java application to the phyphox app on your phone to remotely start and stop the connection and get the data from the experiment in your java application so you can process the data using java (which should be quite usefull for bigger experiments).

## Phyphox Project
The phyphox project can be found here:
https://github.com/Staacks/phyphox-android

## Examples
An example implementation that can be used with the Phyphox default experiment "Acceleration with g" is to be found in the view package (mostly in the controller class PhyphoxInterfaceVisualisationController).
